# Employee Management System using Java Swing

Project Description:
The Employee Management System is a Java Swing-based application designed to help Human Resource Officers manage all the employees in a company. The application allows the user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the employee profile.

The employee profile includes essential details such as name, employee ID, age, gender, start date, level, team info, position title, contact info, and photo. The contact info includes a cell phone number and email address.

The application allows the user to create a new employee profile by entering all the required information. The user can also read the existing employee profile, update the profile details, or delete an employee profile if required.

The search functionality allows the user to search for employee profiles based on different search options such as name, employee ID, and other fields. The application displays the photo of the employee in the employee profile view.

Overall, the Employee Management System provides an easy-to-use interface for Human Resource Officers to manage and track employee information efficiently.
